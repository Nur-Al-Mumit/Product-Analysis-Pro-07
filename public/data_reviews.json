I chose to write this review to warn others that the issue with my Echo (dying after a year) is a common issue. This is a great product, but the quality isn't there. If you purchase it, be sure to get the extra warranty coverage and factor that into the total cost of the purchase. Amazon needs to do a much better job of taking care of its loyal customers. This was a huge disappointment and definitely makes me think twice about ordering a larger ticket item from Amazon.", "review_rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "product_company": "Amazon", "profile_name": "AD", "review_title": "Quit working after one year"},

I was a bit disappointed at first: the name (Alexa) could not be preprogramed and chosen. Secondly, there were limits on other applications and linking equipment. It has slowly gotten better in the number of things you can do with it and Amazon has made some effort to continue to grow its applicability.", "review_rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "product_company": "Amazon", "profile_name": "Carl", "review_title": "Very good purchase.
